      Project 1. Calculator
      Description: Write a program that mimics a calculator. The program should take as input two
      integers and the operation to be performed. It should then output the numbers, the
      operator, and the result. For division, if the denominator is zero, output an
      appropriate message. Limit the supported operations to + - / * and write an error
      message if the operator is not one of the supported operations. Here is some
      example output: 3 + 4 = 7, 13 * 5 = 65
